4.5 Bugs
The bug I encountered was the navigation bar not displaying properly at mobile view because I used hamburger menu style. I fixed this bug by adding some media query for menu-item class by giving it a width 100% at max-width: 600px and making it important

At mobile view, menu items also displayed horizontally and scattered instead of vertically so I used clear both to separate them and make them display vertically in mobile view

Login into my GitHub account
